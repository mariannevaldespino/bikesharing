## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, creating a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
1. Checkout Times for Users

The most common time for bikes to be checked out is at 10 minutes.
